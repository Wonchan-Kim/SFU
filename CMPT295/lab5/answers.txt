1. I ran two tests on the remote CSIL lab and CSIL workstations. CSIL remote lab has 'Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5220R CPU @ 2.20GHz', and CSIL workstations has '13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900'. 

2. I tried controlling REPS; 20000000 and 200000000. When the REPS was comparably smaller, each #2 version was faster except for mul function. In XEON CPU, polynomial1 was slower approximately 100ms, is_odd showed significant difference which was about 3000ms. However, when it comes to mul, mul2 was approximately 10ms slower. In the 13th Gen CPU, however, every #2 function were faster; polynomial2 was faster approximately 80ms, is_odd2 was faster approximately 440ms and mul2 was faster approximately 100ms. 
When the REPS became ten times bigger, entire execution time became much bigger, polynomial2 was 1000ms faster, is_odd2 was 30000ms faster, however mul1 was 100ms faster than mul2 in XEON CPU. polynomial2 was 600ms faster, is_odd2 was 4200ms faster, and mul2 was 1000ms faster in 13th GEN CPU.
